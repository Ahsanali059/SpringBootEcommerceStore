=> Difference between "HTTP Basic Authentication" and "HTTP Digest Authentication"
	-> Basic :-
		= Basic Authentication uses base64 encoding (not encryption) for genrating our cryptographic string which contains the information of username and password
		= It is easier to implement
	-> Digest :-

		= It is complex to implement
