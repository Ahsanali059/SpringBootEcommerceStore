what is Docker?

Docker is a Company 
Contanier is like a Virtual Machine 
Docker Engine is tool this is used to create contanier 

why we use Docker Engine ?

First learn what is Virtulization ?

In Virtulization we create Saparate virtual Machine and 
install over os and software and dependencies to run over application 
and then share with operation or testing team 
Virtulization Connected with Hyperviser 
Hyperviser Creates the vm (virtual machines)
Every vm have a own os and software and reserved a sepecific RAM
Every vm reserve a space like 8gb 2gb use or never use 

Docker is a advance Virtulization tool 
Docker working is to create Continarization 

Layer 1:           Hardware
Layer 2:              OS
Layer 3:          Docker Engine--->same like Hyperviser
Layer 4:          many contaniers -->same like Virtual Machine 

Contanier does not have own os. 

It use Hardware Operating system.
It use space and operating system from Hardware
It is very Lightweight because no os present here But software also there 
Contanier Contains only software 
Container fetch all dependency from Docker hub 
Docker hub contains all of dependencies
Contanier khud say dependencies Docker hub say fetch karta hay

Note:If we create our own image and deploy into docker hub then other person need this 
image then this person pull this image in own container and use this thats8
