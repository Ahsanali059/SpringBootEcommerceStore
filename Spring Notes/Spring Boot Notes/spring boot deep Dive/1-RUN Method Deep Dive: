RUN Method Deep Dive:

Run method responsiblities:

->run method create a Banner of spring boot 
->run method bootsrap over application 

->Run method create the contanier(ApplicationContext) for me
->This method return me ConfigurableApplicationContext thats why we can store this in over ConfigurableApplicationContext variable 
ConfigurableApplicationContext applicationCotext = springApplication.run();

Why it is returning ConfigurableApplicationContext ?

ConfigurableApplicationContext is a generic Type means ConfigurableApplicationContext contanier implements applicationContextContanier and all other contaniers extends the ConfigurableApplicationContext contanier 

->Know we are able to get beans from container 
->SpringBootConfigration:
This is marker annotation it internally having a Configration annotation 
Keep this annotation over any configration file this is marker annotation which will let other developer know that this file holds bean defination 
this annotation we use in main method 

mainMethod / main starter file uses three annotations 
@SpringBootConfigration
@ComponentScan
@EnableAutoConfigration 

instead of using this one by one use "@SpringBootApplication" 

->run method help to create some listners
