=> Named Queries in JPA :-
	-> Named queries in JPA are queries to which we assign a particular name, making them easier to reference and reuse throughout our application
	-> We can declare named queries in an entity class or in xml file
	-> Syntax :-
		= In an entity class :-
			@NamedQuery(name="queryName", query="----JPQL-----")
			public class Student
			{
				//----
			}
			
		= In xml file (orm.xml)
			<named-query name="queryName">
				<query> ----JPQL----- </query>
			</named-query>
			
	-> NOTE :-
		= Named queries in JPA are primarily used for selecting data (SELECT query). These are not used for inserting, updating or deleting data (INSERT, UPDATE or DELETE queries)
		
	-> Advantages of Named Queries :-
		1. Code Reusability :-
			= Named Queries can be reused in different parts of our application, reducing the code duplication. This enhances the consitency and readability of our code
		2. Code Maintability :-
			= Named Queries centralize query definitions, making it easier to maintain and update queries across our application. When a query needs modification, we can update it in one place and all the references to that query will automatically updated
		3. Type Safety :-
			= Named Queries are checked for correctness at compile time, which helps to catch the errors early in the development process
		etc
