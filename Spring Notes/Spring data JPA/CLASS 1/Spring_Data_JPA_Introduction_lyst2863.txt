=> Spring Data JPA :-
	-> Spring Data JPA is the part of larger Spring Data Project which provides a simplified and consistent way to work with JPA in spring-based application
	
	-> Spring Data JPA provides some "Repository Interfaces" which provides a convenient way to perform common database operations without writing the actual database queries or boilerplate code
	-> Some Repository Interfaces present in Spring Data JPA are :-
		1. Repository
		2. CrudRepository
		3. PagingAndSortingRepository
		4. JpaRepository
		   etc
	-> Hierarchy of Repository Interfaces :-
		= diagram
		
	-> All Spring Data JPA Repository Interfaces provides 2 types of methods :-
		1. Core CRUD Operation Methods
			= Used for basic data manipulation
		2. Query Methods
			= Used to define custom queries using method naming conventions or custom JPQL/SQL queries
