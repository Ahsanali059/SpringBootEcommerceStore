Application Scope:

In Framework like servlet based application "application scope"
refers to a scope in which an object is shared and available 
throughout the entire application lifetime 

1-Long Lifespan:
->Objects with application scope are created when the web 
application starts up and are kept alive until the application 
is shut down 

2-Shared Among Users
->Since the object is created only once for the entire application, 
it is shared among all users and all parts of the application

->This can be useful for storing and sharing data that should be consistent 
across all users, such as configuration settings, shared resources, 
or cached data.

3-ServletContext:
->In Java-based web applications, the application scope is often implemented using the Servlet 
Context object, which represents the entire web application.

->Objects stored in the application scope can be accessed and modified by any part of the 
application through the ServletContext.
