  How to create a Bean 

->Using xml(bean.xml)

	class College 
	{

	}



    <bean id="CollegeBean" class="com.example.MyColleges.College">
    

    </bean>

working:when we define this beans College Object is created and 
register the perticular object in IOC Container/Application Context when we need to use this we simple use 
           getBean("BeanId"); 
		   
Note:<bean id="CollegeBean" class="com.example.MyColleges.College">
    

    </bean>

this same thing we can do this by using java annotation 

@Component
class College
{

}	

while we are creating bean using java we dont provide id bydefault
id is e.g ClassName is College Id is college
          ClassName is Student Id is student 
we can provide by manually 

@Component("studentBean") 
class Student
{


}

beans.xml 

<context:component-scan base-package = "" ></context:component-scan>		  


@Value Annotation 
this is used to inject the value like
  
  @Value("Ahsan ali") 
  private String MyName;
