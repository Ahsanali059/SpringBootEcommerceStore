=> What is difference between @NotNull, @NotEmpty and @NotBlank :-
	= @NotNull :- Objects, Arrays, Collections, Map, CharSequence should not be null but can be empty
	= @NotEmpty :- Objects, Arrays, Collections, Map, CharSequence should not be null and size should be greater then 0
	= @NotBlank :- The string should not be null and the trimmed length should be greater then 0
	
	
=> @Min and @Max :-
	= They are used for integers
	
=> @Past and @Future :-
	= They are used for Date (java.util)
	
=> What is difference between @Size and @Length :-
	= @Size is a Bean Validation annotation that validates that the associated String has a value whose length is bounded by the minimum and maximum values.
	= @Length is a Hibernate-specific annotation and has the same meaning as @Size
	
=> @Range :-
	= It can be used for integer values in which we specify min and max values

=> Spring Interceptors :-
	-> If we want pre-processing and post-processing service for any controller class then we have to use spring interceptors
	-> For example, we use spring interceptors in logging services, authentication services, validation services, encryption/decryption services etc
	
	-> To create interceptors spring has provided one interface i.e. "HandlerInterceptor"
	-> HandlerInterceptor contains 3 methods :-
		1. preHandle()
		2. postHandle()
		3. afterCompletion()
