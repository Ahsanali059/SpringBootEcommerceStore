		1. Using pre-defined spring provided classes (Errors) [org.springframework.validations]
		2. Java Bean Validations API (JSR-303 or JSR-349 or JSR-380)
		
		
=> Java Bean Validations API :-
	-> It contains "Java Bean Validations Annotations" and "Hibernate Validator Annotations" for validations in spring mvc framework
	-> NOTE : Hibernate is the vendor which implements JSR
	-> It is very famous API for validations
	
	-> Annotations used are :-
