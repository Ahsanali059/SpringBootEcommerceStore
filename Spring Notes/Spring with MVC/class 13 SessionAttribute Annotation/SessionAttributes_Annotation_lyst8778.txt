=> @SessionAttributes
	-> It is an annotation provided by spring to store the data in session area
	-> We can set any type of data in SessionAttributes
	-> If we want to delete session object :-
		= We have to create SessionStatus reference
		= Then we have to call sessionStatus.setComplete() method
	-> It is declared at class level
	-> For example :-
		@Controller
		@SessionAttributes("------")
		public class FirstController
		{
			------------
		}
		
	-> NOTE :
		= Be careful while using @SessionAttributes because it may be possible that first developer can delete the session object which is used by another developer
		= For permanent session attributes, e.g. a user authentication object, use the traditional session.setAttribute method instead
