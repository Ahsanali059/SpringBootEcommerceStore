Single Responsible principle:

Defination:
Every Software component should have a single reason to change 

           OR
Every Software component should have a single Responsibility 

Meaning:

Hum na ek application baniy hay ure ek class bahiy hay ure us ka andar sub khuch rakh dia e.g
removeReminder
addReminder
isValidReminderId
saveReminder
and more 

This is the problem in sub ko ek class ka andar nahi rakhna we will discuss in next class we will follow single responsible principle


Working with Single Responsible principle 
Every Software/class(component) should have a single responsibility  

Jis tarha hum na upper Reminder Class ka andar sari funtionality rekh di thi ab wo class sub khuch janti hay is lia single responsible principle say that A class dons't know everthing
